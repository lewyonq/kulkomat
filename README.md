## Project Description

**Kulkomat** is a web application designed to digitize and enhance the loyalty program for an ice cream shop. It replaces traditional, physical stamp cards with a virtual system for collecting stamps and discount coupons. The primary goal is to solve the common problem of customers forgetting or losing their physical cards, which leads to frustration and loss of accumulated benefits.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend & Database**: Supabase
- **CI/CD & Hosting**: GitHub Actions, DigitalOcean (via Docker image)
